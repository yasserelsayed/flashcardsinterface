"Learning a new language can be a daunting task, and one of the questions that often arises is how many words one needs to learn to achieve a certain level of proficiency."

"Beginner Level"
"At the beginner level, learners are typically focused on basic communication skills such as introducing themselves, asking for directions, and ordering food in a restaurant. In order to achieve this level of proficiency, learners need to know around 1,500 to 2,000 words."

"Intermediate Level"
"At the intermediate level, learners are able to hold more complex conversations and understand more nuanced language. They are able to express their opinions, talk about their interests, and describe their experiences. To achieve this level of proficiency, learners need to know around 4,000 to 6,000 words."

"Advanced Level"
"At the advanced level, learners are able to communicate effectively in a wide range of situations and understand complex texts and speeches. They are able to express themselves fluently and accurately and use language creatively. To achieve this level of proficiency, learners need to know around 10,000 to 15,000 words."
